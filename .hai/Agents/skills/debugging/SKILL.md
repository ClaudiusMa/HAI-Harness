description: Diagnose and repair a reported bug using discriminating evidence, one scoped correction at a time, and a check of the original symptom. Use for uncertain causes or failed repairs; known, reproduced corrections can use the same method without a separate coordinator.

# Debugging

Use the current task's expected behavior, scope, lane and authority. Workers can use this method directly for obvious, reproduced, bounded fixes. Claudia routes unclear causes, repairs that failed without an established cause, and investigations needing intermittent/runtime/cross-component evidence to [Momus](../../momus.md). An ordinary bug or test failure does not require a new agent, report or review cycle.

## Establish the incident

Read the current contract/handoff and latest authoritative requirement. Record expected versus actual behavior, the failing inputs/environment and prior applied fixes. Reuse one task-centric handoff; for a simple case a few evidence lines suffice. Keep parent/controller, lane/candidate, authority, cumulative unsuccessful fixes and current next action there so resumes and worker changes preserve the incident.

Prefer an existing focused command/test or agent-operated interaction. Otherwise use a tiny fixture, browser/manual steps or captured failure evidence. Record the actual failing observation and exact steps/candidate; do not invent a baseline or revert user/peer work to produce one. Ask only for missing behavior, access or an interaction you cannot perform. Reuse the agreed pathway on later attempts.

## Diagnose before changing behavior

Trace the relevant path and compare a working case; reduce inputs while keeping the symptom. Distinguish observations from hypotheses. Choose a plausible, falsifiable hypothesis and the cheapest check that separates it from alternatives. State its prediction and record the outcome as supported, rejected or inconclusive. Do not require a fixed hypothesis count or perfect reproducibility.

Use an existing debugger, REPL, focused test, trace or profiler before adding instrumentation. If source/test/config probes are needed, the authorized worker owns them and their cleanup; Momus never writes them. Keep logs small, task-marked and redacted. A logging service or NDJSON is optional, never required.

For intermittent failures, use a bounded observation plan with counts, conditions and seeds/time where useful. A captured real failure can justify a discriminating probe; a clean run proves only its tested conditions. If evidence cannot support a cause, report not reproduced or diagnosis inconclusive and the exact missing evidence. Avoid speculative repairs presented as proven causes.

## Apply one correction and recheck

Explain the supported cause, gaps, one proposed causal correction and the symptom check. Existing local repair authority carries through the loop; diagnosis-only remains read-only. Material expected-behavior decisions, wider scope, high-cost checks and production/outward actions retain their existing gates.

The worker applies one coherent correction, adds regression coverage when it catches the real failure pattern at a useful seam, runs focused checks and returns the actual candidate/diff. Do not add tests that merely restate wording or mirror implementation. Reject or undo a failed probe/fix only through its owner's attributable edits after inspecting the current diff; preserve baseline, user and peer work. Never stack speculative corrections or reset/stash/clean a lane.

Re-run the original symptom and relevant neighboring behavior against the final candidate after temporary probe cleanup. For UI bugs inspect the rendered interaction at the relevant viewport/theme; typecheck is insufficient. For harness bugs compare the latest instruction to the actual role, task and lane. Momus, when routed, independently performs this symptom verification. Existing substantive source-review obligations may be satisfied by assigned Momus review when he did not implement the change; no duplicate review is required solely because debugging occurred.

Label a verified correction, mitigation or unverified result accurately. A mitigation has its own checked scope and limits. Retained instrumentation needs a concrete reason, owner and revisit condition.

## Bound the loop

After each unsuccessful applied fix, keep its worker/candidate, prediction, attributable changes, observed result and the evidence informing the next attempt in the same handoff. A failing baseline, diagnostic probe or unavailable environment is not itself an applied fix. Continue only when useful new evidence supports the next correction.

Default: stop before a fourth unsuccessful applied fix for the same incident. Stop sooner for no useful new evidence, missing access, unclear authority, scope/resource collisions or a serious new regression. A new session, worker, slug or resume never resets the count. Report attempted explanations, unresolved evidence and the access/product/architecture decision needed; do not infer an architecture defect merely from three failures. Additional attempts or wider scope need a revised authorized approach recorded with the existing history.

Close with the supported cause, correction, fresh symptom evidence, limits and next owner/action. Keep integration, publication and cleanup status separate from the verified behavior; follow the native lane lifecycle and preserve unfinished work/resources.
