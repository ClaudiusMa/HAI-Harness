# Design Guide

<!--
## How To Use This File

- This is the project's single source of truth for concrete visual style:
  tokens, components, spacing, type, motion, and voice.
- Builders (Augustus, Julius) read it before writing any UI and match it.
- Reviewers (Athena, Hephaestus) check the artifact's adherence to it. When a
  style choice conflicts with an outside pattern, THIS FILE wins — it is the
  project's truth, not the reviewer's preference.
- Replace every placeholder below with your real design system. Delete the
  sections you don't need; add the ones you do.
- Already have a design system elsewhere (a shared brand repo, a component
  library, a Figma spec)? Point `AGENTS.md` at that source instead of filling
  this in, and keep this file as a short pointer to it.

The concrete visual language for this project. Builders match it; reviewers
check adherence to it. If it is not written here, it is not the standard.

## Overview

- Product / surface this guide covers:
- Design intent in one line (the feeling and priorities — e.g. calm, dense,
  playful, enterprise-serious):
- Platforms / breakpoints:
- Light / dark support:

## Colors

Define tokens by role, not raw hex scattered through the UI.

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color.bg` | `#______` | Page background |
| `color.surface` | `#______` | Cards, panels |
| `color.text` | `#______` | Primary text |
| `color.text.muted` | `#______` | Secondary text |
| `color.primary` | `#______` | Primary action |
| `color.border` | `#______` | Dividers, outlines |
| `color.success` / `warning` / `danger` | `#______` | Status |

- Contrast target (e.g. WCAG AA 4.5:1 for body text):

## Typography

- Font family (UI / mono):
- Type scale (size / line-height / weight):

| Role | Size | Line height | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Display | | | |
| Heading | | | |
| Body | | | |
| Caption | | | |

## Spacing & Layout

- Spacing scale (e.g. 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32):
- Grid / max content width:
- Density stance (compact vs. comfortable, and where each applies):

## Elevation & Depth

- Surface layers and when to raise (shadow / border / background step):

## Motion

- Duration + easing tokens:
- What animates, what must not (respect reduced-motion):

## Shape & Radius

- Corner radii by component size:
- Border weights:

## Components

The canonical component set. Reuse these before inventing new UI; a new
component needs justification.

| Component | Variants | Notes / when to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Button | primary / secondary / ghost / destructive | |
| Input | | |
| Card | | |
| Table | | |
| Modal / Sheet | | |
| Toast / Banner | | |

## States

Every screen must handle these. Define the standard treatment for each so
builders and reviewers judge against one bar.

- **Empty** — first-use / no data:
- **Loading** — skeleton vs. spinner, when:
- **Error** — message tone, recovery action:
- **Disabled** — why-disabled affordance:
- **Permission** — no-access / restricted:
- **No-results** — filtered/searched to nothing:
- **Long-content** — truncation / wrapping / overflow:
- **Many-record** — pagination / virtualization / bulk actions:
- **Partial-success** — some items failed:
- **Destructive-action** — confirmation, undo:

## Voice & Content

- Tone (e.g. plain, human, specific — no vague "Manage" / "Submit"):
- Capitalization, punctuation, number/date formats:
- Terminology to use / avoid:

## Accessibility

- Keyboard: all actions reachable and operable:
- Focus states: visible and consistent:
- Labels: inputs, icons, and controls have text equivalents:
- Color is never the only signal (pair with text / icon / shape):
- Minimum target size:

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do:**
- **Don't:**
